This creates a simple Neural Network that takes in 9 different factors and creates 400 hidden features, from this it scales these statistics into a linear model to approximate the output. This was tested on a dataset with car costs and other factors with over 8000 samples.
Uses pandas library to process and clean these 8000 samples, accurately predicts car costs based on the number of training runs, in the future I hope to fine tune the ratios in the neural network to get a more accurate build of the network to get much closer to 100% accuracy.
In the future I hope to simplify the network to run samples more efficiently, or scale down the dataset into less factors to see if we are able to better predict it with less factors that are more important instead.
